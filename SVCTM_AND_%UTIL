== A Necessary Fix for Service Time and Utilization in Iostat ==

I've been using iostat from the sysstat package for some time now
and think I stumbled over an inconsistency regarding svctm.

== Symptom ==

Often I observe the following iostat output for a lightly loaded disk:

[root@somehost ~]# iostat -x sdc 5 1
Linux 2.6.32-573.1.1.el6.x86_64 (somehost)     02/22/16        _x86_64_        (32 CPU)

avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.83    0.00    0.35    0.19    0.00   98.64

Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s   rsec/s   wsec/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await  svctm  %util
sdc               0.00    12.55   56.26   37.64  3543.71   725.77    45.47     0.04    0.39   0.11   1.05

sysstat package is 9.0.4. "somehost" is a physical Linux server,
no VM. sdc is an SSD with a queue_depth of 256:

[root@somehost ~]# cat /sys/block/sdc/device/queue_depth 
256

What one can see is that avgqu-sz is small (0.04) but await and
svctm show a large difference (0.39 vs 0.11). It's unlikely that
the response time await is dominated by waiting time in the queue
(await-svctm=0.28) when there is almost no request waiting
(avgqu-sz=0.04). Or put another way: On a system with 256 available
IO slots and no requests waiting one would expect every incoming
request to be serviced by the disk immediately (await=svctm). Only
when avgqu-sz is larger than the queue depth of 256 I would expect
there to be a noticeable difference between await and svctm.

I think the calculation of svctm is buggy.

== Analysis ==

iostat calculates svctm from /proc/diskstats (or other statistics
files but with the same content), using field 10, field 1 and field
5 (following the numbering in
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/iostats.txt). From field
1 and 5 one can calculate the number of transactions per second (or
1000 ms) t.

The problematic field is field 10. According to this site

https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.1/pt-diskstats.html

field 10 counts the time when at least one request is being serviced
by the disk.

=== Single queue, single server ===

For a disk which can only service one request simultaneously, field
10 is fine and can be used to calculate the utilization. In queueing
theory this would be a single queue with a single server. When the
disk is 100% busy this means that for every 1000 ms wall clock time
field 10 increases by 1000 too. When t requests have been serviced
during the 1000 ms then the service time must be 

	1000ms/t = (delta(field 10) in ms)/t

which is what svctm shows. 

=== Single queue, multiple servers ===

For a disk which can process multiple requests at a time (256 in
our example), field 10 is useless. 

Assuming the disk can service N requests simultaneously then we
have a system with a single queue and N servers in queueing theory
terms. Instead of "server" I call that device IO slot. Let's further
assume that t is large and each of the IO slots is working at maximum
utilization=100%.

It's fair to assume that the requests are distributed evenly
among the N IO slots, so (taking the numbers from above) every 1000
ms wall clock time, each IO slot processes t/N requests.

Field 10 still increments by 1000 ms every second, because there
is at least one service request active all the time, leading to
svctm=1000ms/t again.

But the service time should reflect the time that a single server
(aka IO slot) takes to process a request, ie in our case t/N requests
in 1000 ms wall clock time. IE the proper service time is N*1000ms/t,
so svctm is wrong (too small) by a factor of N !

In order to determine the proper service time one needs N. Queue
depth might be 1 for some devices, 32 for others or 256 for SSDs.
In the block layer we don't know N for the specific device. But
we have field 11. According to 

https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.1/pt-diskstats.html

field 11 counts the milliseconds spent servicing IOs for all currently
processed requests.

We recall our assumption that t requests are serviced by the entire
disk in 1000 ms wall clock time and that each IO slot is working
at maximum utilization, i.e. for every 1000 ms wall clock time, each
IO slot spends 1000 ms servicing IOs. As we've seen field 10 will
still increment by 1000 for every 1000 ms wall clock time. Field
11 however will increase by N*1000 because it counts the time spent
for *all* requests. We can now determine the proper service time:

proper service time 	= (1000 ms)/(t/N) = (N*1000 ms)/t = 
			= (delta(field 11) in ms)/t

In the border case of N=1 field 11 and field 10 increase
by the same amount, so the formula with field 11 still applies.

==== Arbitrary utilization ====

The discussion was made with the assumption that each IO slot
is working at maximum utilization. Is the formula still valid,
when the utilization per IO slot is between 0% and 100%?

When the utilization is below 100% then we can't assume that all
requests are handled evenly by the IO slots. It might also be that
one IO slot handles all requests, and another IO slot does nothing.

But on average we know that t requests have been processed during
1000 ms wall clock time and that, summed over all requests, these
took delta(field 11) ms to complete. So IO time spent for an 
average request is still:

proper service time	= (delta(field 11) in ms)/t

The svctm is still wrong by a factor between 1 and N.

=== %util ===

For utilization there is no easy fix. The proper formula for 
a period of 1000ms wall clock time would be

%util = (delta(field 11) in ms)/(N*1000ms) * 100%

but we don't know N. One could omit the N and define a
new variable

load = (delta(field 11) in ms)/(1000 ms)

The load would range between 0 and N (with N unknown) and
indicate the average number of requests executing in parallel in 
the disk (or hba for that matter). Even with N unkown this
would be still better than the current %util which is nearly
useless.

== Suggested solution ==

iostat should be using rq_ticks (field 11) from diskstats to calculate
svctm not tot_ticks (field 10).

%util should be removed and replaced by a new variable load.
